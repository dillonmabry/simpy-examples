"""
Fuel Station Refueling example per SimPy documentation:
https://simpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/gas_station_refuel.html

This example covers various differences in changing the refilling
threshold percentage as well as differences in customer behavior.

1. Customers arrive at a fuel station with n number of stations at
exponentially distributed interarrival times

2. Customers have one of three tank sizes: small, medium, large
and refill their tanks based on how much fuel they need at a triangular
distribution with most people filling 90-100% of their tank up.

3. The tanker truck is called when the station pump drops below a
certain threshold defined

4. The tanker truck takes a constant time to arrive and constant time
to refill the main pump

Covers:

- Resources: Resource
- Resources: Container
- Waiting for other processes

Scenario:
  A fuel station has a limited number of fuel pumps that share a common
  fuel reservoir. Cars randomly arrive at the fuel station, request one
  of the fuel pumps and start refueling from that reservoir.

  A fuel station control process observes the fuel station's fuel level
  and calls a tank truck for refueling if the station's level drops
  below a threshold.
